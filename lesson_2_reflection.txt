What happens when you initialize a repository? 

-An empty Repository is created out of the file or directory, in which it was created.

Why do you need to do it?

-Repositories are needed to work with version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- In the Staging area I can collect a lot of files and bring them to a reasonable order at the same time. In this manner I can do logical commits. It is a kind of conjunction plateau, a structured area, where I can make sure the commits make sense.
