When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- This could be usefull when working with other people on the same project. Every contributer can store changes in the common repository to discuss them an work with them. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Doing all changes manually gives every committer working on a share project to refer to previous changes and to understand, what some other contributer might have done and why. There may be experimental changes, that shouldn't be pulled to a different version on a local computer for the projects sake.
