What happens when you initialize a repository? 

- An empty Repository is created out of the file or directory, in which it was created.

Why do you need to do it?

- Repositories are needed to work with git.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

- You can recognize the process of development done by different people. Thus, it's possible to go back to a single commit, which is located in a different working branch.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

- It simply saves a lot of time. If there's no conflict, there is no reason to do it manually. Maybe sometimes I'd like to discuss some of the changes made by me and a collegue or even more people. Thus it would be fine to work together on single changes.
